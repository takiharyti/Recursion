# Recursion
This program was created to study by creating the following functions using recursion:
* Factorial
* Checking if a number is to the power of 2 (2^n)
* Reversing string.
* Finding GCD using Euclid's method.
* Decimal to binary & binary to decimal.
* Printing a triangle.

Created the following recursive functions for array variables.
* Printing arrays forwards and backwards.
* Reversing array.
* Find the mode of the array.
* Gridpath.
* Bubble sort.
* Insertion sort.

# What I Learned
* Dynamic use of creating functions recursively.
* Bubble and insertion sort.
* Method overloading.
